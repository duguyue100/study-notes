## Chapter 12: Central Visual Pathways

### Overview

+   Visual areas in the temporal lobe are primarily involved in object
    recognition, whereas those in the parietal lobe are concerned with motion.

### Central Projections of Retinal Ganglion Cells

+   Ganglion cell axons exit the retina through a circular region in its
    nasal part called the __optic disk__, where they bundle together
    to form the optic nerve.

+   Axons in the optic nerve run a straight course to the __optic chiasm__
    at the base of the diencephalon.

+   The ganglion cell axons on each side from the __optic tract__.

+   The major target of ganglion cella axons in the optic tract in the
    diencephalon is the __dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus__ of the thalamus.

+   A second major target of ganglion cell axons is a collection of neurons
    that lies between the thalamus and the midbrain in a region known as the
    __pretectum__.
    +   particularly important as the coordinating center for
        the __pupillary light reflex__.

+   Pretectal neurons project to the __Edinger-Westphal nucleus__, a small
    group of nerve cells that lies close to the nucleus of the oculomotor
    nerve (cranial nerve III) in the midbrain.

+   These axons pass through a portion of the internal capsule called the
    optic radiation and terminate in the __primary visual cortex__ (V1),
    or __striate cortex__ (also referred to as __Brodmann's area 17__),
    which lies largely along and within the calcarine fissure in the
    _occipital lobe_.

+   The __retinogeniculostriate pathway__, or __primary visual pathway__,
    conveys information that is essential for most of what is thought of
    as seeing.

+   Under normal conditions, the pupils of both eyes respond identically,
    regardless of which eye is stimulated.

+   Retinal ganglion cell axons have several other important targets:
    +   One is the __suprachiasmatic nucleus__ of the hypothalamus,
        a small group of neurons at the base of the diencephalon
    +   The __retinohypothalamic pathway__ is the route by which variation
        in light levels influences the broad spectrum of visceral functions
        that are entrained to the day-night cycle.
    +   __superior colliculus__, a prominent structure visible on the dorsal
        surface of the midbrain. The superior colliculus coordinates head and
        eye movements to visual (as well as other) targets.
