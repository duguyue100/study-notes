+   Ganglion cell axons exit the retina through a circular region in its
    nasal part called the __optic disk__, where they bundle together
    to form the optic nerve.

+   Axons in the optic nerve run a straight course to the __optic chiasm__
    at the base of the diencephalon.

+   The ganglion cell axons on each side from the __optic tract__.
