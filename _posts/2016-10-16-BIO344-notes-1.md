## Chapter 23: Construction of Neural Circuits

### Overview

+ The first step in this process is to establish axons and dendrites in the newly generated neurons.
  + Once established, axons grow to reach appropriate target cells
    + which can be local or distant,
    + and begin to make the synaptic connections 
      + that will form neural circuits.
  + The dynamic behavior of growth cones depends in turn on adhesive, attractive, and repulsive signals in the embryonic environment
+
