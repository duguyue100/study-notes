## Chapter 1: Studying the Nervous Systems

### Overview
+   A coherent understanding of brain structure and function has been explored
    successfully concern how the principal cells of all animal nervous system --
    __neurons__ and __glia__ -- perform their functions in anatomical, electrophysiological,
    cellular, and molecular terms.

+   Neural circuits, which are the primary components of neural systems that
    process specific types of information.

### Genetics, Genomics, and the Brain

+   Gene
    +   _coding_ DNA: template for messenger RNA (mRNA) that will be translated
        into protein.
    +   _regulatory_ DNA: control whether and in what quantities that gene
        is expressed.

+   __Genomics__ focus on the analysis of complete DNA sequences, both coding
    and regulatory.

+   A great deal of "brain-specific" genetic information resides in the
    introns and regulatory sequences that control timing, quantity,
    variability, and cellular specificity of gene expression.

+   Using the tools of genetics and genomics, single-gene mutations have
    been identified that result in rare but devastating changes in brain
    development and function.
