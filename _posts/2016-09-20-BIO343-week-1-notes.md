## Chapter 1: Studying the Nervous Systems

### Overview
+   A coherent understanding of brain structure and function has been explored
    successfully concern how the principal cells of all animal nervous system --
    __neurons__ and __glia__ -- perform their functions in anatomical, electrophysiological,
    cellular, and molecular terms.

+   Neural circuits, which are the primary components of neural systems that
    process specific types of information.

### Genetics, Genomics, and the Brain

+   Gene
    +   _coding_ DNA: template for messenger RNA (mRNA) that will be translated
        into protein.
    +   _regulatory_ DNA: control whether and in what quantities that gene
        is expressed.

+   __Genomics__ focus on the analysis of complete DNA sequences, both coding
    and regulatory.

+   A great deal of "brain-specific" genetic information resides in the
    introns and regulatory sequences that control timing, quantity,
    variability, and cellular specificity of gene expression.

+   Using the tools of genetics and genomics, single-gene mutations have
    been identified that result in rare but devastating changes in brain
    development and function.

### The Cellular Components of the Nervous System

![Cell morphologies]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/bio-imgs/chapter1-1.png)

+   The cells of the nervous systems

    +   __nerve cells__, or __neurons__: Nerve cells are specialized for
        electrical signaling over long distances.

    +   __glial cells__, or __neuroglia__ or __glia__: glial cells support
        rather than generate electrical signals. They also serve additional
        functions in the developing and adult brain. Perhaps most important,
        glia are essential contributors to repair of the damaged nervous
        system, acting as _stem cells_ in some brain regions, promoting
        regrowth of damaged neurons in regions where regeneration can
        usefully occur, and preventing regeneration in other regions where
        uncontrolled regrowth might do more harm than good.

### Neurons

![diagram of nerve cells]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/bio-imgs/chapter1-2.png)

+   __Dendrites__ are the primary targets for synaptic input from the __axon__
    terminals of other neurons and are distinguished by their high content of
    _ribosomes_, as well as by specific _cytoskeletal proteins_.

+   The number of inputs to a single neuron reflects the degree of
    __convergence__, while the number of targets innervated by any one neuron
    represents its __divergence__.

+   Typically, the axon terminal of the __presynaptic__ neuron is immediately
    adjacent to a specialized region of __postsynaptic__ receptors on the
    target cell.

+   pre- and postsynaptic components communicate via the _secretion of
    molecules_ from the presynaptic terminal that bind to receptors in the
    postsynaptic cell.

+   These molecules must traverse an interval of extracellular space between
    pre- and postsynaptic elements called the __synaptic cleft__.

+   Axon, the portion of the nerve cell specialized for relaying electrical
    signals, a unique extension from the neuronal cell body that may travel
    a few hundred micrometers ($$\mu m$$) or much farther, depending on the
    type of neuron and the size of the animal.

+   Relatively short axons are a feature of __local circuit neurons__,
    or __interneurons__, throughout the brain. The axons of
    __projection neurons__, however, extend to _distant targets_.

+   The event that carries signals over such distances is a self-regenerating
    wave of electrical activity called an __action potential__, an
    all-or-nothing change in the electrical potential (voltage) across the
    nerve cell membrane that conveys information from one point to another
    in the nervous system.

+   An action potential propagates from its point of initiation at the cell
    body (the __axon hillock__)

+   The _chemical_ and _electrical processes_ by which the information encoded
    by _action potentials_ is passed on at synaptic contacts to a target cell
    is called __synaptic transmission__.

+   Synapses

    +   __chemical synapses__, the most abundant type of synapse in the nervous
    system.

    +   the __electrical synapse__ (facilitated by the
        _gap junctions_), is relatively rare and has special functions.

+   __synaptic vesicles__, the secretory organelles, spherical structures
    filled with __neurotransmitter molecules__ (or simply
    __neurotransmitters__).

### Glial Cells

+   __Glia__ are more numerous than neurons in the brain by a ratio of
    perhaps 3 to 1.

+   Glial cells' supportive functions help define synaptic contacts and
    maintain the signaling abilities of neurons.

+   Cells with glial characteristics are the only apparent stem cells
    retained in the mature brain

+   Glial functions
    +   maintaining the ionic milieu of nerve cells;
    +   modulating the rate of nerve signal propagation;
    +   modulating synaptic action by controlling the uptake and metabolism
        of neurotransmitters at or near the synaptic cleft;
    +   providing a scaffold for some aspects of neural development;
    +   aiding (or in some instances impeding) recovery from neural injury.

![Types of glial cells]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/bio-imgs/chapter1-3.png)

+   Types of Glial cells
    +   __Astrocytes__: restricted to the central nervous system, to maintain,
        in a variety of ways, an appropriate chemical environment for neuronal
        signaling.

    +   __Oligodendrocytes__, restricted to the central nervous system,
        lay down a laminated, lipid-rich wrapping called __myelin__ around some,
        but not all, axons.

    +   __Microglial cells__, derived primarily from hematopoietic precursor
        cells, _scavenger cells_ that remove cellular debris from sites of
        injury or normal cell turnover.

+   __Glial stem cells__ are found throughout the adult brain, retain the
    capacity to proliferate and generate additional precursors or
    differentiated glia and, in some cases, neurons.
    +   _astrocytes_ found primarily near the ventricles in a region called
        +   the _subventricular zone (SVZ)_ or
        +   adjacent to _ventricular zone blood vessels_.
        +   _SVZ astrocytes_ can give rise to more stem cells, neurons, and mature
            astrocytes and oligodendroglial cells. They have the
            key properties of all stem cells: _proliferation_, _self-renewal_,
            and the capacity to make all cell classes of a particular tissue.
    +   _oligodendroglial_ precursors scattered throughout the white matter
        and sometimes referred to as _polydendrocytes_
        +   they give rise primarily to mature oligodendroglial cells as well
            as to some astrocytes

### Neural Circuits

+   Neurons are organized into ensembles called __neural circuits__ that
    process specific kinds of information and are the foundation of sensation,
    perception, movement, and behavior.

+   __Neuropil__ constitutes the regions between nerve cell bodies where most
    synaptic connectivity occurs.

+   The basic constituents of all neural circuits.
    +   Nerve cells that carry information from the periphery _toward_
        the brain or spinal cord (or deeper centrally within the
        spinal cord and brain) are called __afferent neurons__.

    +   Nerve cells that carry information _away_ from the brain or spinal
        cord (or away from the circuit in question) are __efferent neurons__.

    +   __Interneurons__ (local circuit neurons) participate only in
        the local aspects of a circuit

+   Example of neural circuits: __myotatic reflex__ ("knee-jerk" reflex)

![the knee-jerk response]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/bio-imgs/chapter1-4.png)

+   A more detailed picture of neural circuit can be obtained by
    __electrophysiological recording__, which measures the electrical activity
    of a nerve cell. There are two approaches to this method:
    +   __extracellular recording__, where an electrode is placed near the
        nerve cell of interest to detect its activity. Particularly useful for
        +   detecting temporal patterns of action potential activity
        +   relating those patterns to stimulation by other inputs
            or to specific behavioral events
    +   __intracellular recording__, where the electrode is placed inside the
        cell of interest.
        +   detect the smaller, graded changes in electrical potential
            that trigger action potentials,
        +   allow a more detailed analysis of communication between neurons
            within a circuit.

### The Organization of the Human Nervous System

+   __Sensory systems__ that acquire and process information from the
    environment.

+   __Motor systems__ that respond to such information by generating movements
    and other behavior

+   __Associational systems__: large numbers of cells and circuits that lie
    between these relatively well defined input and output systems (sensory
    and motor systems).

![the CNS and PNS]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/bio-imgs/chapter1-5.png)

+   __The central nervous system__, typically referred to as the __CNS__,
    comprises the brain (cerebral hemispheres, diencephalon, cerebellum,
    and brainstem) and the __spinal cord__.

+   __The peripheral nervous system (PNS)__ includes the sensory neurons that
    link sensory receptors on the body surface or deeper within it with
    relevant processing circuits in the central nervous system.
    +   motor portion of the peripheral nervous system
        +   The motor axons that connect the brain and spinal cord to
            skeletal muscles make up the __somatic motor division__.
        +   the cells and axons that innervate smooth muscles, cardiac muscle,
            and glands make up the __visceral__ or __autonomic motor
            division__.

+   Nerve cell bodies that reside in the PNS are located in __ganglia__, are
    simply local accumulations of nerve cell bodies and supporting cells.

+   Peripheral axons are gathered into bundles called __nerves__, many of which
    are enveloped by the glial cells of the PNS.

+   Nerve cells in the CNS are arranged in two different ways.
    +   __Nuclei__ are local accumulations of  neurons that have roughly
        similar connections and functions.
    +   __Cortex__ describes sheet-like arrays of nerve cells.

+   Axons in the central nervous system are gathered into __tracts__. Tracts
    that cross the midline of the brain are referred to as __commissures__.

+   __Gray matter__ refers to any accumulation of cell bodies and neuropil in
    the brain and spinal cord.

+   __White matter__ refers to axon tracts and commissures.

+   __Visceral motor division of the PNS__
    +   Visceral motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord ---
        the so-called _preganglionic neurons_- form synapses with peripheral
        motor neurons that lie in the __autonomic ganglia__. Innervate smooth
        muscle, glands, and cardiac: muscle, thus controlling most
        involuntary (visceral)  behavior.
    +   __Sympathetic division__: the ganglia lie along or in front of the
        vertebral column and send their axons to a variety of peripheral
        targets.
    +   __Parasympathetic division__: ganglia are found within or adjacent to
        the organs they innervate
    +   __Enteric system__, is made up of small ganglia as well as individual
        neurons scattered throughout the wall of the gut. These neurons
        influence gastric motility and secretion.
