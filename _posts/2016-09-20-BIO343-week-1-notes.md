## Chapter 1: Studying the Nervous Systems

### Overview
+   A coherent understanding of brain structure and function has been explored
    successfully concern how the principal cells of all animal nervous system --
    __neurons__ and __glia__ -- perform their functions in anatomical, electrophysiological,
    cellular, and molecular terms.

+   Neural circuits, which are the primary components of neural systems that
    process specific types of information.

### Genetics, Genomics, and the Brain

+   Gene
    +   _coding_ DNA: template for messenger RNA (mRNA) that will be translated
        into protein.
    +   _regulatory_ DNA: control whether and in what quantities that gene
        is expressed.

+   __Genomics__ focus on the analysis of complete DNA sequences, both coding
    and regulatory.

+   A great deal of "brain-specific" genetic information resides in the
    introns and regulatory sequences that control timing, quantity,
    variability, and cellular specificity of gene expression.

+   Using the tools of genetics and genomics, single-gene mutations have
    been identified that result in rare but devastating changes in brain
    development and function.

### The Cellular Components of the Nervous System

+   The cells of the nervous systems

    +   __nerve cells__, or __neurons__: Nerve cells are specialized for
        electrical signaling over long distances.

    +   __glial cells__, or __neuroglia__ or __glia__: glial cells support
        rather than generate electrical signals. They also serve additional
        functions in the developing and adult brain. Perhaps most important,
        glia are essential contributors to repair of the damaged nervous
        system, acting as _stem cells_ in some brain regions, promoting
        regrowth of damaged neurons in regions where regeneration can
        usefully occur, and preventing regeneration in other regions where
        uncontrolled regrowth might do more harm than good.

### Neurons

![diagram of nerve cells]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/bio-imgs/chapter1-2.png)

+   __Dendrites__ are the primary targets for synaptic input from the __axon__
    terminals of other neurons and are distinguished by their high content of
    _ribosomes_, as well as by specific _cytoskeletal proteins_.

+   The number of inputs to a single neuron reflects the degree of
    __convergence__, while the number of targets innervated by any one neuron
    represents its __divergence__.

+   Typically, the axon terminal of the __presynaptic__ neuron is immediately
    adjacent to a specialized region of __postsynaptic__ receptors on the
    target cell.

+   pre- and postsynaptic components communicate via the _secretion of
    molecules_ from the presynaptic terminal that bind to receptors in the
    postsynaptic cell.

+   These molecules must traverse an interval of extracellular space between
    pre- and postsynaptic elements called the __synaptic cleft__.

+   Axon, the portion of the nerve cell specialized for relaying electrical
    signals, a unique extension from the neuronal cell body that may travel
    a few hundred micrometers ($$\mu m$$) or much farther, depending on the
    type of neuron and the size of the animal.

+   Relatively short axons are a feature of __local circuit neurons__,
    or __interneurons__, throughout the brain. The axons of
    __projection neurons__, however, extend to _distant targets_.

+   The event that carries signals over such distances is a self-regenerating
    wave of electrical activity called an __action potential__, an
    all-or-nothing change in the electrical potential (voltage) across the
    nerve cell membrane that conveys information from one point to another
    in the nervous system.

+   An action potential propagates from its point of initiation at the cell
    body (the __axon hillock__)

+   The _chemical_ and _electrical processes_ by which the information encoded
    by _action potentials_ is passed on at synaptic contacts to a target cell
    is called __synaptic transmission__.

+   Synapses

    +   __chemical synapses__, the most abundant type of synapse in the nervous
    system.

    +   the __electrical synapse__ (facilitated by the
        _gap junctions_), is relatively rare and has special functions.

+   __synaptic vesicles__, the secretory organelles, spherical structures
    filled with __neurotransmitter molecules__ (or simply
    __neurotransmitters__).

### Glial Cells

+   __Glia__ are more numerous than neurons in the brain by a ratio of
    perhaps 3 to 1.

+   Glial cells' supportive functions help define synaptic contacts and
    maintain the signaling abilities of neurons.

+   Cells with glial characteristics are the only apparent stem cells
    retained in the mature brain

+   Glial functions
    +   maintaining the ionic milieu of nerve cells;
    +   modulating the rate of nerve signal propagation;
    +   modulating synaptic action by controlling the uptake and metabolism
        of neurotransmitters at or near the synaptic cleft;
    +   providing a scaffold for some aspects of neural development;
    +   aiding (or in some instances impeding) recovery from neural injury.

![Types of glial cells]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/bio-imgs/chapter1-3.png)

+   Types of Glial cells
    +   __Astrocytes__: restricted to the central nervous system, to maintain,
        in a variety of ways, an appropriate chemical environment for neuronal
        signaling.

    +   __Oligodendrocytes__, restricted to the central nervous system,
        lay down a laminated, lipid-rich wrapping called __myelin__ around some,
        but not all, axons.

    +   __Microglial cells__, derived primarily from hematopoietic precursor
        cells, _scavenger cells_ that remove cellular debris from sites of
        injury or normal cell turnover.

+   __Glial stem cells__ are found throughout the adult brain, retain the
    capacity to proliferate and generate additional precursors or
    differentiated glia and, in some cases, neurons.
    +   _astrocytes_ found primarily near the ventricles in a region called
        +   the subventricular zone (SVZ} or
        +   adjacent to ventricular zone blood vessels.
        +   _SVZ astrocytes_ can give rise to more stem cells, neurons, and mature
            astrocytes and oligodendroglial cells. They have the
            key properties of all stem cells: _proliferation_, _self-renewal_,
            and the capacity to make all cell classes of a particular tissue.
    +   _oligodendroglial_ precursors scattered throughout the white matter
        and sometimes referred to as _polydendrocytes_
        +   they give rise primarily to mature oligodendroglial cells as well
            as to some astrocytes
