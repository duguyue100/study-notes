## Chapter 1: Dualism

### Introduction

+   __Substance Dualism__
    +   Body
        +   a physical object
        +   locate in space
        +   made from the atoms familiar to chemistry
        +   has certain weight and height
        +   can be seen and touched
    +   Mind
        +   nonphysical object
        +   not located in space
        +   not made from the atoms familiar to chemistry
        +   has neither weight nor height
        +   can't be seen or touched
    +   Mind and body are different sorts of things or _substances_
        +   mental substances
        +   physical substances
    +   the philosophical doctrine of substance dualism takes no stand on the
        afterlife one way or the other.
    +   mind and body, whilst quite distinct, interact with one another.
        +   sensory information about the state of the world is sent
            from brain to mind
        +   decisions about how to react are sent from mind to brain
    +   The body itself makes no decisions
