## Chapter 1: Dualism

### Introduction

+   __Substance Dualism__
    +   Body
        +   a physical object
        +   locate in space
        +   made from the atoms familiar to chemistry
        +   has certain weight and height
        +   can be seen and touched
    +   Mind
        +   nonphysical object
        +   not located in space
        +   not made from the atoms familiar to chemistry
        +   has neither weight nor height
        +   can't be seen or touched
    +   Mind and body are different sorts of things or _substances_
        +   mental substances
        +   physical substances
    +   the philosophical doctrine of substance dualism takes no stand on the
        afterlife one way or the other.
    +   mind and body, whilst quite distinct, interact with one another.
        +   sensory information about the state of the world is sent
            from brain to mind
        +   decisions about how to react are sent from mind to brain
    +   The body itself makes no decisions

### Arguments in favor of substance dualism

+   The formulation in the following arguments is based on Leibniz's
    _principles of the indiscernibility of identicals_.

+   Language
    1.  Minds can use language.
    2.  No physical object can use language.
    3.  Therefore, minds are not physical objects.
    +   Above argument was formulated by Descartes.
    +   The rules of grammatical sentences are called __syntax__ of the language.
    +   The words and sentences of a language is called the __semantics__ of that language.

+   Reasoning
    1.  Minds can engage in reasoning.
    2.  No physical object can engage in reasoning.
    3.  Therefore, minds are not physical objects.
    +   Descartes' second premise.

+   Consciousness
    1.  Minds can be conscious
    2.  No physical object can be conscious.
    3.  Therefore, minds are not physical objects.

+   Doubt and existence
    +   In the _Meditations_, Descartes noticed that he could doubt the existence of his body.
    +   Descartes' premises
        1.  I can doubt that I have a body.
        2.  I cannot doubt that I exist. 
        3.  (from 1 and 2) I am not my body.
        4.  My mind is not my body.
    +   There is a catch

### Arguments against substance dualism

1.  Princess Elizabeth's argument.
    +   If mind and body are supposed to be radically different, how can they causally interact?
    +   By Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia.
    +   Crucial point is that the substance dualist has said absolutely nothing about the details of the interaction.

2.  The explanatory completeness of physiology.
    +   It's clear that the theory offered by the physiologist is a _physical_ one.
    +   If we can explain people's actions without nonphysical substances, then: the nonphysical mind does not 
        cause people to behave as they do.

3.  The explanatory weakness of substance dualism.
